- duck typing: extensible like C++
- focus on properties: there's behaviour, and there's data
- one language: fewer server or client -specific investments
- lispy: no pitfalls, flexible langauge development
- unnested bindings: I just want a new variable
- purity: please no object webs
- anti-identifier-styling: for sanity's sake, unify Javascript and Python identifier styles (scopable)
- prototypes: because they work for modules and plain objects
