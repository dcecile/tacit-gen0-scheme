Integral tech that I still don't get:
- Coroutines
- Delimited continuations
- Capability-based security
- Dataflow and reactive concurrency
- Lisp macros
- Performance profiling
- Interactive debuggers

Related technology that I won't pay attention to:
- Garbage collection
- Hindley-Millner type inference
- GPU shader languages
- High concurrency I/O (including epoll and SleepEx)
- Untrusted code (capabilities, and time/space isolation)
