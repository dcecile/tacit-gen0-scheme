\begin{itemize}
\item Flow-style needs to be weeded out, and a sound syntax determined.As things stand, it's too confusing.
\item Namespace @ operator not yet officially banned.
\item Syntaxes of lists, sets, dictionaries, and lambdas are all too ambiguous.
\item No unified plan for list expansion, property assignment, modification assignment, pointer assignment, and multi-assignment.
\item Spaceless syntax doesn't work when dots or spaces are required for property assignment and argument specification.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The core language requires a large set of functional-programming semantics: tail calls, closrues, copy-on-write, pointers...
\end{itemize}
