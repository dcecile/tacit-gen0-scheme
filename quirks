- duck typing: extensible like C++
- connoted types: no restrictions on genericity
- focus on properties: there's behaviour, and there's data
- significant whitespace: don't torture the beginners
- purity: please no object webs
- FFI: it's not a vacuum
- interactive: pause the program, not the programmer
- performance: no expressivity divides
- values: local working set, independent copies
- RPN: no operators, good partial application for HOFs, reading order transformations
- scoped global state: monads and DSLs for the rest of us
- localized syntaxes: for the rest of the world
